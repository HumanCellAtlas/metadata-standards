You can find details on getting connected to the Data Coordination Platform in general and the different email lists and slack channels specifically on the [HCA general wiki](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/wiki/wiki)

If you aren't sure where to go, email or slack message Laura Clarke at EBI 

# metadata-standards
The first version of the metadata standards are being created in the [Ingest Google folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-rEFaPQ8v3GcE5RSm0zQUl4MDQ) 

The suggested entities and fields are listing in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NCRMtRT8lOaOzBKTRYh8tlCC_UuUmWmQk4KWlv5_9EA/edit?usp=sharing) 

If you have questions, want to understand how a particular data type fits in this model please ask over email [metadata-wg@humancellatlas.org](mailto:metadata-wg@humancellatlas.org) or the slack channel #hca-metadata. Providing example data with your query is always a great idea.
