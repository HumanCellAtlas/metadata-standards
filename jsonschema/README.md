The "JSON schema" descriptions of HCA json modules lives here.
Some standards we try to adhere to about the structure of these things:

1) If a field symbol is made up of more than one word, use _ to separate the words.
2) Most field symbols are all lower case
3) All fields and all objects have a description.
